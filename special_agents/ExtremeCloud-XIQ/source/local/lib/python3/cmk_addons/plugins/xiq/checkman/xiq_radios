description:
 This check monitors radio information for ExtremeCloudIQ access points.
 It evaluates per-band (2.4GHz / 5GHz / 6GHz) client counts, observed channels,
 and transmit power values (average and minimum).

 The check state is determined by two independent threshold groups:

 - {CRIT} if minimum TX power is <= critical threshold
 - {WARN} if minimum TX power is <= warning threshold
 - {CRIT} if total clients >= critical threshold
 - {WARN} if total clients >= warning threshold
 - {OK}   otherwise

discovery:
 One service is created per detected radio band.
